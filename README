QuickTile, a WinSplit clone for X11 desktops

Keybindings for --daemonize can be listed via --show-bindings and edited (after
the initial run) in ~/.config/quicktile

For details and non-keybinding use, see --help.

Requirements:
 - Python 2.4+ (Tested with 2.5 on 2011-09-10. Developed on 2.7)
 - PyGTK 2.2 (assuming get_active_window() isn't newer than that)
 - X11 (The code expects _NETWM hints and X11-style window decorations)
 - python-xlib (optional, required for key-binding, tested with 0.15_rc1)
 - dbus-python (optional, required for D-Bus service, tested with 0.83.2)

Thanks to Thomas Vander Stichele for some of the documentation cleanups.
