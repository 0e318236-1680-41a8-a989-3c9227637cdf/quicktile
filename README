QuickTile, a WinSplit clone for X11 desktops

When using --daemonize, keybindings are Ctrl+Alt+0 through Ctrl+Alt+9 and
Ctrl+Alt+Enter (keypad only). For non-keybinding use, see --help.

Requirements:
 - Python 2.3 (Tested on 2.5 but I don't see any newer constructs in the code.)
 - PyGTK 2.2 (assuming get_active_window() isn't newer than that)
 - X11 (The code expects _NETWM hints and X11-style window decorations)
 - python-xlib (optional, required for key-binding, tested with 0.12)
 - dbus-python (optional, required for D-Bus service, tested with 0.82.4)

Thanks to Thomas Vander Stichele for some of the documentation cleanups.
