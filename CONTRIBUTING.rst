Before You Open An Issue...
===========================

1. Please check the `FAQ <http://ssokolow.com/quicktile/faq.html>`_ to make
   sure it isn't a known problem or a feature that's been declared out-of-scope
   for QuickTile.

2. Try the newest version of QuickTile to see if it's already been fixed/added.

3. Search for open bugs to verify that someone else hasn't already reported
   the problem.

4. If you're reporting a bug, please attach the terminal output from running
   QuickTile with ``--debug`` and then triggering the problem.

5. If you're reporting a bug that resulted in the "A programming error has been
   detected during the execution of this program." dialog, please attach the
   traceback from the ``Details...`` button.

Thanks for making it easier for me to help you.
