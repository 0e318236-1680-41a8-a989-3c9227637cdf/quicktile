QuickTile
=========

QuickTile is a simple utility, inspired by WinSplit Revolution for Windows,
which adds window-tiling keybindings to your existing X11 window manager.

You can also think of it as a standalone alternative to the keyboard-related
features of the Compiz Grid plugin.

For more details, see the illustrations in the :doc:`commands`.

QuickTile depends on the Python bindings for libraries you :ref:`probably
already have <Dependencies>` and can be run :ref:`without installing
<install_quicktile.sh>` to easily try it out.
